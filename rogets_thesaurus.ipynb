    "# Roget's Thesaurus in the 21st Century\n",
    "\n",
    "The first known thesaurus was written in the 1st century CE by [Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos); it was called *Περὶ τῶν διαφόρως σημαινομένων*, loosly translated in English as *On Synonyms*. Fast forward about two millenia and we arrive to the most well known thesaurus, compiled by [Peter Mark Roget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mark_Roget), a British physician, natural theologian, and lexicographer. [Roget's Thesaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roget%27s_Thesaurus) was released on 29 April 1852, containing 15,000 words. Subsequent editions were larger, with the latest totalling 443,000 words. In Greek the most well known thesaurus, *Αντιλεξικόν ή Ονομαστικόν της Νεοελληνικής Γλώσσης* was released in 1949 by [Θεολόγος Βοσταντζόγλου](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%98%CE%B5%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%92%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B6%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85); the latest updated edition was released in 2008 and remains an indispensable source for writing in Greek.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roget organised the entries of the thesaurus in a hierarchy of categories. Your task in this assignment is to investigate how these categories fare with the meaning of English words as captured by Machine Learning techniques, namely, their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is an assignment that requires initiative and creativity from your part. There is no simple right or wrong answer. It is up to you to find the best solution. You have three weeks to do it. Make them count."
